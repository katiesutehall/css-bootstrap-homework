CSS Bootstrap Homework

For this homework assignment, I created a portfolio with an About Me page, Portolio page to display my future projects, and a Contact Me page. I utilized Bootstrap to create rows and columns and a responsive design.

I first created a Navbar using Boostrap and customized the background color, tabs, and font size using Google Fonts ( I applied this font to the text on all pages) and a Footer, which I also customized. I applied this code to all 3 .html pages.

On the About Me page, I used 3 rows with 1-2 columns in each. I added a photo and used the border-radius feature to give it rounded edges. 

On the Portfolio page, I desided to use cards from Bootstrap to showcase each project. It was difficult at first to keep the sizing of the cards consistent, so I ended up setting the height and width of each card in my .css page. 

For the Contact me page, I used a form from Boostrap and customized the labels and placeholder text in the text fields.

In order to add the responsive elements, I used a media query for the 640, 786, and 980 size and applied a block display and changed the margins on different elements, classes, and ids. 

One of the most difficult parts of this project was editing the styling of the Boostrap elements to get them to look how I wanted. For example, the background color od the navbar was difficult to change at first and required more research. Formatting the cards on the Portfolio page was also difficult to get right. 

Once I finished styling the pages on the large screen size, it was especially difficult maintaining the styles (primarily the margin sizes) once I started shrinking the screen size. The styling on the smallest screen size was the easiest to manipulate, however the tablet size was more challenging to get right. Overall, I learned a lot by trial and error and by researching media queries online. 

Fun fact: while I was studying marketing in college, my professor stated that screen responsiveness, especially for mobile, was extremely important for SEO. I always wondered how to create a mobile responsive site and now thanks to this homework assignment, I now know!
